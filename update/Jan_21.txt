The paper below is the paper we should review get understand how the model works for the large scale distributed deep network.
Meanwhile read tensorflow paper to get the idea how they implemented from the work. At this point 3 things need to think

how the SGD and L-BFGS model works.
think a question how we can apply the original coded scheme or naive scheme to the Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS
read tensor flow paper to find the relation between SGD/L-BFGS with tensor flow(best write a quick summary for self understanding

For reverse indexing: two homeworks due next Monday(Jan 28)
what is Map, reduce function and write pseudocode based on your function. and what is your key and value
what do we send in the shuffle based on the code from naive scheme(nrgnmr.py). The theory for naive scheme is we will create many files named as form of a_b_c_d.txt where the file stored at location a and b, the file is sending to location d. The range for a,b,d is same as the amount of users, c is select between 1 or 2. you guys are welcome to try and play the code. to see how it works.

for the resource for reverse indexing: I can provide several links quick searched by google. feel free to search by your own.

see you guys at 12 in my cube next Monday(Jan 28). we can walk to eat at some nearby cafeteria and discuss the work you have done from past week
